# Hero Section Web Page

This project is a minimal, dependency-free web page constructed using vanilla JavaScript and basic CSS. It focuses exclusively on the implementation of a single, well-structured Hero section designed to showcase a product, service, or message.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5 for structural markup
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity
- No frameworks or external libraries are used

## Software Development Concepts Applied

Although the implementation is intentionally minimal, the development approach reflects high-level engineering principles:

### Separation of Concerns (SoC)

The architecture strictly separates structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript), ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

### Component Isolation

The Hero section is treated as a self-contained unit with clear boundaries. This enables reusability and localized updates without affecting other areas of the UI.

### Progressive Enhancement

The page is fully usable without JavaScript. Enhancements are layered in through scripting, following accessibility-first practices and ensuring compatibility with a wide range of environments.

### Performance-First Delivery

No build tools or bundlers are required. The project is deployable as static assets, resulting in faster load times and fewer potential points of failure.

### Semantic Markup

Semantic HTML improves accessibility and search engine indexing. Content is structured in a way that supports assistive technologies and modern SEO practices.

### Scalability Through Simplicity

By avoiding complexity and dependencies, the code is easier to understand, scale, and integrate into larger systems when needed.
